    "Each verse has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A start with the same string `On the {day} of Christmas my true love sent to me`\n",
    "- An ever growing list of items, with extra ones added to the start of the list. Each item is separated by commas except the first one, which is separated with an \"and\". The first two lines will therefore need to be treated differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how you choose to solve this, you will need at least:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The details of what is new in each verse. This will be provided in the dictionary `christmas_sequence`\n",
    "- One loop to iterate through all the verses and gifts. You may choose to do this with two but you can do it with one.\n",
    "- One conditional statement to check if the verse is the first, second or any other verse."
